## 🌟 Overview
**Akinator: IPL Edition** is a full-stack web application that brings the magic of the famous Genie to the world of Cricket. Using a custom-built deductive reasoning engine, the app can guess any IPL player (past or present) that you are thinking of in 20 questions or less.

Built for a hackathon, this project showcases a blend of **State-Aware AI Logic**, **Interactive UI/UX**, and a **Mobile-First Design**.
